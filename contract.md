1. When and where will we schedule meetings (e.g. 11am Wednesdays and 2pm Fridays: in-person at X location, on Teams video call, on Discord)?
* Meetings will be scheduled in person where possible or through discord. 

2. Where will we record our meeting minutes (e.g. Teams documents, Gitlab Wiki, Gitlab markdown file)?
* Gitlab Wiki

3. Where will we communicate (e.g. Teams channel, Discord, Messenger)?
* Discord for meetings
* Teams for formal instructions

4. What is a reasonable response time for messages/posts when communicating?
* 20-30 minutes

3. How will we handle conflicts (i.e. differing opinions)? Note: If conflicts cannot resolved this way, please contact your tutor.
* First we will talk and see if a resolution can be made that satisfies both our requests, if not we will hold a majority vote to decide which path to continue. Otherwise seek external help via our tutor or course admin.

4. List the steps a team member does if they get stuck (e.g. can't meet a deadline or stuck debugging).
* Check if a solution exists to problem in documentation of course i.e lecture or tutorial material, else ask for help for the group in the Teams chat in said issue.
